Another MRN provided for PROM sent to patient without an appointment MRN 71125-9 (VN 891738)\n\n`send_adm_prom` does not care about appointments, only that the patient goes to status 2.

They had a previous survey expire for them today and no survey was generated for them. This might be weird edge case thing where because there was one still out it didn't generate a new one? That's assuming the expiration happens after the generation though\n    This patient was sent an email with it recorded in prom_logging - they just never filled out the adm survey, so the ENROLL status is correct\n\nMore patients were found on 1/16:\n\n- TOP\n  - 1056161 - sent an email, not recorded in prom_logging\n- ADH\n  - 1055212 - sent an email, recorded in prom_logging, just never filled out their adm prom\n  - 1055400 - wasn\u2019t sent email but didn\u2019t have email address\n  - 1055634 - sent an email, recorded in prom_logging, just never filled out their adm prom",

For example, a complete system ensures that when a process queries a row from pocdart2.demographics, it can be sure that the patient name from IDX is associated. The timing of Sheppard Pratt\u2019s HL7 workflows (SIU) have historically required temporary placeholders (`populate_foreign_key()`) with the expectation that IDX will also activate the workflows (ADT) for the associated visit/pt shortly thereafter to populate associated tables. This transitional state we call \u201cghost records.\u201d Ghost records are defined as:\n\n```\nmysql> select count(*) from visits where mrn is NULL;\n+----------+\n| count(*) |\n+----------+\n|    15546 |\n+----------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> select count(*) from demographics where first_name is null;\n+----------+\n| count(*) |\n+----------+\n|     6686 |\n+----------+\n1 row in set (0.02 sec)\n```\n\nResolution of one such workflow was deployed to the IDX HL7 client in June 2023. Identifying any workflows still actively creating these records requires a one-time cleaning so we can isolate and evaluate them. Resolution means either:\n\n1. Populating all relevant columns associated with that ghost record, or\n2. Deleting the ghost record entirely from the database\n\nOutlook email with appt\\_visit\\_number updates[https://outlook.office.com/mail/inbox/id/AAQkADQ3OTcwZDk0LWFjZmYtNDcyOC05YTIwLTEwMjliZmQ2ZTAyYwAQAM8x61U7eEiYkQvBid8HtrI%3D](https://outlook.office.com/mail/inbox/id/AAQkADQ3OTcwZDk0LWFjZmYtNDcyOC05YTIwLTEwMjliZmQ2ZTAyYwAQAM8x61U7eEiYkQvBid8HtrI%3D \"smartCard-inline\")\n\n**DoD**: no records exist in pocdart2.demographics or visits that have only an identifier to allow us to identify existing workflows that are still creating them.",

        "desc": "As part of the V2 deployment, there are planned changes to the Proxy project to add parent-proxy measures that are currently used for patients under the age of 12 years. Parent-proxy measures will be available only using the proxy PROM buttons and outcomes section. In addition, the patient PROMs for pediatric will lower the minimum age to 8 to match the official minimum age used by HealthMeasures.\n\nSite managers were informed of these changes on Friday, 12/2 but drew concerns from Robert who stated he was not aware of these changes being part of the V2 deployment and was concerned that user fidelity would drop as a result of these changes (for Community in particular as users would have to engage with the proxy PROM system for the first time). Feedback from Community site managers thus far do not indicate any major concerns about the changes. Proxy PROMs may be added on the project level to account for continued parent-proxy reporting consistency for younger patients.\n\nThis card was created to represent any work related to communication with users about the V2 changes, as well as completing a post-mortem about how communication about these project changes got lost over the course of the last few months of the deployment process.",

Adjustments to those key names have been made and the template is now making the emails correctly.\n~~Only outstanding issue now is that a Python package~~ `bs4` ~~is needed to be added to pocdart_docker python images in order to utilize said package for the unit testing added as a part of fixing this issue.~~ Package issue has been resolved.\n\nDeployment of new code has been pushed and stats show up via Emily. However, the stats seem to be counted incorrectly.\nAndrew and I have reviewed and found there is an issue with the total telehealth printout that is counting all appts tied to surveys - they should be just all appts due for that provider.\nWe have also found that the individual stats have been counted incorrectly as it is only counting surveys that have an appt tied to them instead of just all surveys due that day for that provider. Awaiting Emily feedback to confirm if the above counting is a true error.",

Adjustments to those key names have been made and the template is now making the emails correctly.\n~~Only outstanding issue now is that a Python package~~ `bs4` ~~is needed to be added to pocdart_docker python images in order to utilize said package for the unit testing added as a part of fixing this issue.~~ Package issue has been resolved.\n\nDeployment of new code has been pushed and stats show up via Emily. However, the stats seem to be counted incorrectly.\nAndrew and I have reviewed and found there is an issue with the total telehealth printout that is counting all appts tied to surveys - they should be just all appts due for that provider.\nWe have also found that the individual stats have been counted incorrectly as it is only counting surveys that have an appt tied to them instead of just all surveys due that day for that provider. Awaiting Emily feedback to confirm if the above counting is a true error.",

This will alter how we look for PRN follow-ups on the dashboard. I have attached an info sheet outlying some things that will now happen.\n\nBasically, the trigger of giving a PRN creates a PRN follow-up order. That order shows as a task on the MAR for the users to complete.\n\nThis is currently active in TEST, but we are still finalizing what PRN follow-up task we will use. Currently, it is assigned to the same task form as the Pain Medications.",

Malstrom) appeared on the dashboard with an \u2018enroll\u2019 status despite completing PROMs previously. Patient completed an admission PROM on 10/25 during the appointment.\n\n10/25-10/26: Amber and Jacqui review community REDCap to find all records associated with the patient MRN and name. Only 1 [record](https://sheppardpratt.healthcare/redcap/redcap_v13.10.4/DataEntry/record_home.php?pid=19&id=3790&arm=1 \"\u200c\") is found, associated with the admission PROM completed on 10/25.\n\n10/27: Kylie Hall confirms that the patient has been admitted to Timonium location with Kayleigh as the primary therapist since 2021.\n\n11/8: Kayleigh states that the PROMs were previously completed sometime in September 2023 and a custom PROM was added. She states that the patient confirmed completing them before 10/25:\n\n\u201c_Yes I did this most recently (prior to the deletion) probably the beginning/mid September.\u00a0 I remember that I did it because I was adding a new PROM- one that is out of the automatic ones. I also asked the client if we had done them before and she also agreed.\u00a0I added the borderline symptom list. And I did it through the webpage of DMAR. The client would usually do the assessments during the session.\u00a0 Yes the completed scores would appear on the Hub. She said she never got any emails/texts prior to 10/25_\u201d\n\nJacqui reviewed both Community REDCap projects for this patient and found that the patient was marked as \u2018exempt\u2019 until 10/25/2023. The first PROM notification sent to the patient was on 10/25/2023.  An email has been associated with this patient since 8/20/2022; a cell was added on 2/14/2023. There are no records of this patient completing PROMs before 10/25 in REDCap",

There doesn't appear to be any weird same-day scheduling going on.\n\nThe first patient has the DEs confused, so monitoring another patient in BHP that is also enroll status and belongs to the same visit location to see if there is something weird going on with that visit location. Upon reviewing, the example patient `04DDD235-790A-4687-AC89-3E191EBCAAFF` was found to be not enrolled on Saturday (10/21 \\@ 2 pm) but was found on Monday (10/23) to be enrolled and sent a PROM.\n\nSecond patient had an incomplete initial survey marked as completed (survey\\_intro was marked as completed but never actually took anything in the battery), so removed reset survey\\_intro to hopefully resolve issue.\n\n\u200c\n\nAdditional problematic patients have been found on 10/24 dashboard review:\n\\- `BDC55E55-EC24-4350-BB58-B8A37BF11C09`\n\\- `5FCFF2C2-E15A-462D-91A2-3BFB620E0E35`\n\\- `1DD6DC32-D9C7-4170-80E2-6EAD9C5A02C0`\n\\- `180D2E1A-14F7-49B0-990E-0C2F0A7DF63C`",

Viewing emails assigned to you only allows you to see emails that are due within the week or are overdue, and there was no visible way to configure automatic statuses or due dates. A ticket is being submitted via the Contact Us page in regards to that functionality. If this functionality exists or will be implemented by the devs, this is looking like a great replacement for MailClark.",
